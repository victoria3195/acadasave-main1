--Hello everyone
--welcome to bootstrap class


--below are the guidelines to follow to set up your bootstrap using CDN
#go to bootstrap website and get your current version
#go to documentation
#copy the css minified version and paste it at the head tag of your html
#copy the jquery and the javascript minified version and paste it close to the closing body tag of your html.

--note
--jquery must always be the first script tag and must be on top of other script tag

#after setting up your script files and your css files, we added our first bootstrap component which is the navbar.
--to get the navbar, use the search input on the documentation page to search for any component/html element you want to work with.

--for navbar, type Navbar and click on the Navbar dropdown that will pop up to open different type of navbar for you to choose from.



--bootstrap grid system
#on the searchbar, type grid and you will get a pop up to click on


--to use the grid system, follow these steps

#create a div with a class of row
#inside the row div, create another div with these classes listed below
--col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-1 
--note, you can make your col-lg-1 if you want to maintain margin on both left and right of 
your page and add content into the middle div which has col-lg-10 and col-xl-10 which means you will be having a structure like this below

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-1 col-xl-1"></div>
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-10 col-xl-10"></div>
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-1 col-xl-1"></div>
</div>

--if you don't want left and right margin, you can have the structure below for two content 
side by side on large screen
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6 col-xl-6"></div>
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6 col-xl-6"></div>
</div>

--for three content side by side, this is the structure below
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-4 col-xl-4"></div>
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-4 col-xl-4"></div>
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-4 col-xl-4"></div>
</div>


--for four content side by side, this is the structure below
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-3 col-xl-3"></div>
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-3 col-xl-3"></div>
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-3 col-xl-3"></div>
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-3 col-xl-3"></div>
</div>

--col-sm-12 is the class called on a particular div or content when a small device is used to
view that content

--col-md-12 is the class called on a particular div or content when a medium device is used to
view that content

--col-lg-12 is the class called on a particular div or content when a large device is used to
view that content



--26th july 2023
--last week sunday, we learnt how to add wavy background to our bootstrap application.
--to do this, visit www.getwave.into
--set your wave pattern
--download or copy the svg code
--on your app, create a section and add the svg inside
--create another section and add the bottom part of the svg in the second section

#note, when you are creating your svg on getwave.io, it gives you the option to download the top and bottom part of the said svg

--in between both section containing the svg, create another section and add your bootstrap card
--use the same background color of your svg as background of that new section and it will blend
--do your responsiveness to remove border lines on both small and large devices/medium
